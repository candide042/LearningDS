Hello World Repo. Candide is on a mission to learn DS in Python, building on their knowledge of Data Science in R. 

The Challenge is to not write a single line of code, but use ChatGPT et al to solve increasingly harder DS problems.

It starts with committing this README to github via my Mac terminal using CHatGPT's instructions.

Happy Learning!
